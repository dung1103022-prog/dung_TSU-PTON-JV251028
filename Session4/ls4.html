        <b>A website</b>(also written as a <b>web site</b>) is any <span class= "text">web page</span> whose content is identified by a common <span class>domain name</span> and is published on at least one <span class= "text">web server</span>. 
        Websites are typically dedicated to a particular topic or purpose, such as news, education, commerce, entertainment, or <span class= "text">social media</span>. 
        <span class= "text">Hyperlinking</span> between web pages guides the navigation of the site, which often starts with a home page. 
        The <span class= "text">most-visited</span> sites are <span class= "text">Google, YouTube,</span> and <span class= "text">Facebook.</span>[1][2]
        All publicly-accessible websites collectively constitute the <span class= "text">World Wide Web.</span> 
        There are also private websites that can only be accessed on a <span class= "text">private network</span>, such as a company's internal website for its employees. 
        <span class= "text">Users</span> can access websites on a range of devices, including <span class= "text">desktops, laptops, tablets,</span> and <span class= "text">smartphones</span>. 
        The <span class= "text">app</span> used on these devices is called a <span class= "text">web browser</span>.
